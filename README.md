OWASPÂ® ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web application security control library that makes it easier for programmers to write lower-risk applications. The ESAPI for Java library is designed to make it easier for programmers to retrofit security into existing applications. ESAPI for Java also serves as a solid foundation for new development.

# Special note regarding Spring Boot 3, Spring 6, Tomcat 10 and other applications / libraries requiring Jakarta EE
<table border=<5>
<tr>
<td>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> We are aware that all versions of ESAPI (unless you are using very select parts) do not work with Jakarta EE. Jakarta EE relies on <b>jakarta.servlet-api</b>. ESAPI is built to use <b>javax.servlet-api</b>. This causes things like Spring Boot 3, Spring 6, Tomcat 10, the latest version of Jetty, etc. to fail to load certain (well, many) ESAPI classes. The reason for this is that the package names between these 2 libraryes are different! The dependency <b>javax.servlet-api</b> has a package namespace of <code>javax.servlet</code>. The <b>jakarta.servlet-api</b> library is using the package namespace of <code>jakarta.servlet</code>. So references to things like <code>ServletRequest</code>, <code>ServletResponse</code>, etc. in ESAPI are using <code>javax.servlet.ServletRequest</code> and <code>javax.servlet.ServletResponse</code> respectively. We cannot make it work for both at once and we will not stop supporting <b>javax.servlet-api</b>, which is what most of our existing ESAPI clients are using.
<p>
Therefore <b>PLEASE STOP</b> sending us emails and/or creating GitHub issues regarding this! Instead, please
read ongoing the GitHub discussion https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/discussions/768 for further details.

# A word about ESAPI vulnerabilities
A summary of all the vulnerabilities that we have written about in either the
ESAPI Security Bulletins or in the GitHub Security Advisories may be found
in this [Vulnerability Summary](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/Vulnerability-Summary.md).
It is too lengthy, and if you are using the latest available ESAPI version--generally not relevant--to
place in this **README** file.

# Where are the OWASP ESAPI wiki pages?
You can find the official OWASP ESAPI Project wiki pages at
[https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/](https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/).
The ESAPI legacy GitHub repo also has several useful [wiki pages](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/wiki).

# What does Legacy mean?
This is the legacy branch of ESAPI which means it is an actively maintained branch of the project, however significant *new* **feature development** for this branch will *not* be done. Features that have already been scheduled for the 2.x branch will move forward.
Development for the "next generation" of ESAPI (starting with ESAPI 3.0), will be done at the
GitHub repository at [https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java).

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**
* The default branch for ESAPI legacy is the 'develop' branch (rather than the 'main' (formerly 'master') branch), where future development, bug fixes, etc. are now being done. The 'main' branch is now marked as "protected"; it reflects the latest stable ESAPI release (2.5.3.1 as of this date). Note that this change of making the 'develop' branch the default may affect any pull requests that you were intending to make.
* Also, the *minimal* baseline Java version to use ESAPI is now Java 8. (This was changed from Java 7 during the 2.4.0.0 release.)
* Support was dropped for Log4J 1 during ESAPI 2.5.0.0 release. If you need it, configure it via SLF4J. See  the
  [2.5.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.5.0.0-release-notes.txt)
for details.

# Where can I find ESAPI 3.x?
As mentioned above, you can find it at [https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java).

Note however that work on ESAPI 3 has not yet begun in earnest and is only
in its earliest planning stages. Even the code that is presently there
will likely change.

# ESAPI Release Notes
The ESAPI release notes may be found in ESAPI's "documentation" directory. They are generally named "esapi4java-core-*2.#.#.#*-release-notes.txt", where "*2.#.#.#*" refers to the ESAPI release number (which uses semantic versioning).

See the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases) information for a list of releases which generally
link to the specific release notes.

### Really IMPORTANT information in release notes
* Starting with ESAPI 2.2.1.0, important details changed reading the ESAPI
  Logger. If you have are getting things like ClassNotFoundException, you
  probably have not read it. Please be sure to read this specific section
  of the
  [2.2.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.1.0-release-notes.txt#L128-L155)
* Starting with ESAPI 2.2.3.0, ESAPI is using a version of AntiSamy that by default includes 'slf4j-simple' and
  does XML schema validation on the AntiSamy policy files. Please **READ** this
  section from the
  [2.2.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/1312102e79d4ed98d1396f5c56e12f437534d62b/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.3.0-release-notes.txt#L22-L34)
  (at least the beginning portion) for some important notes that likely will affect your use of ESAPI! You have been warned!!!
* ESAPI 2.3.0.0 is the last release to support Java 7 as the minimal JDK.
  Starting with release 2.4.0.0, Java 8 or later is required.

# Locating ESAPI Jar files
The [latest ESAPI release](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases/latest) is 2.5.3.1.
All the *regular* ESAPI jars, with the exception of the ESAPI configuration
jar (i.e., esapi-2.#.#.#-configuration.jar) and its associated detached
GPG signature, are available from Maven Central. The ESAPI configuration
jars are linked under the 'Assets' section to each of the specific
ESAPI releases under the
GitHub [Releases page](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases).


However, **before** you start a *new* project using ESAPI, but sure to read "[Should I use ESAPI?](https://owasp.org/www-project-enterprise-security-api/#div-shouldiuseesapi)".

# ESAPI Deprecation Policy
Unless we unintentionally screw-up, our intent is to keep classes, methods,
and/or fields which have been annotated as "@deprecated" for a
minimum of two (2) years or until the next major release number (e.g.,
3.x as of now), which ever comes first, before we remove them. Note
that this policy does not apply to classes under
the **org.owasp.esapi.reference** package. You generally are not expected
to be using such classes directly in your code. At the ESAPI team's discretion,
it will also not apply for any known exploitable vulnerabilities for which
no available workaround exists.

## Exceptions to Deprecation Policy
We will make some exceptions to the normal 2 year period. In particular, in the
cases were we believe that keeping a specific deprecated class or method around
can introduce security issues (generally because many of you have a habit of
completely ignoring deprecation warnings), we sometimes will shorten that 2 year
period. When we decide to do that, we will announce that as part of the
deprecation message.

## Log4J 1.x Removal
**IMPORTANT NOTES:** As of ESAPI 2.5.0.0, all the Log4J 1.x related code
has been removed from the ESAPI code base (with the exception of some
references in documentation). If you must, you still should be able to
use Log4J 1.x logging via ESAPI SLF4J support. See the ESAPI 2.5.0.0 release
notes for further details.

# Contributing to ESAPI legacy
### How can I contribute or help with fix bugs?
Fork and submit a pull request! Easy as pi! (How's that for an irrational
statement, you math nerds? :) We generally only accept bug fixes, not
new features because as a legacy project, we don't intend on adding new
features that we will have to maintain long term (although we may make
exceptions; see the 'New Features' section in this **README**). If
you are interesting in doing bug fixes though, the best place to start is the
[CONTRIBUTING-TO-ESAPI.txt](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING-TO-ESAPI.txt)

If you are new to ESAPI, a good place to start is to look for GitHub issues labled as 'good first issue'. (E.g., to find all open issues with that label, use [https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).)

Again, please find additional important details in the file
'[CONTRIBUTING-TO-ESAPI.txt](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING-TO-ESAPI.txt)',
which will also describe the tool requirements.

#### Want to report an issue?
If you have found a bug, then create an issue on the esapi-legacy-java repo at [https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/issues)
As of May 11, 2022, we switched back to using (GitHub) issue templates. (We previously used issue templates when our source code repository was still on Google Code.) You can read more about our issue templates in this brief
[announcement](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/discussions/700).

NOTE: Please do **NOT** use GitHub issues to ask questions about ESAPI.
If you wish to ask questions, instead, post to either of the 2 mailing
lists (now on Google Groups) found the References section at the bottom
of this page. If we find questions posted as GitHub issues, we simply will
close them and direct you to do this anyhow. Alternately you may use the new
[Q&A](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/discussions/categories/q-a) section of our GitHub
[Discussions](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/discussions) page to ask questions.

When reporting an issue or just asking a question, please be clear and try
to ensure that the ESAPI development team has sufficient information to be
able to reproduce your results or to understand your question. If you have
not already done so, this might be a good time to read Eric S. Raymond's classic
"[How to Ask Questions the Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html)"
before posting your issue.

#### Find a Vulnerability?
If believe you have found a vulnerability in ESAPI legacy, for the sake of the
ESAPI community, please practice Responsible Disclosure. (Note: We will be sure
you get credit and will work with you to create a GitHub Security Advisory, and
if you so choose, to pursue filing a CVE via the GitHub CNA.)

You are of course encouraged to first search our GitHub issues list (see above)
to see if it has already been reported. If it has not, then please contact
both Kevin W. Wall (kevin.w.wall at gmail.com) and
Matt Seil (matt.seil at owasp.org) directly. Please do not report
vulnerabilities via GitHub issues or via the ESAPI mailing lists as
we wish to keep our users secure while a patch is implemented and
deployed. If you wish to be acknowledged for finding the vulnerability,
then please follow this process. Also, when you post the email describing
the vulnerability, please do so from an email address that you usually
monitor.

More detail is available in the file
'[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)'.
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)'.

### New Features
If you wish to propose a new feature, the best place to discuss it is via
new 'Discussions' board, probably under
'[Ideas](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/discussions/categories/ideas)',
or on the ESAPI-DEV mailing list mentioned below under the References section.
As mentioned previously, we generally are not considering new features
for ESAPI 2.x. This is because:
- ESAPI is already too monolithic and has too many dependencies for its size.
- We are trying to wind down support of ESAPI 2.x and get ESAPI 3.0 going so any
  resources we throw at ESAPI 2.x will slow down that goal.

That said, if you believe you have an idea for an additional simple feature that
does not pull in any additional 3rd party libraries, toss it out there for
discussion or even show us how it works with a PR. (Note that we vet all pull
requests, including coding style of any contributions, so please use the same
coding style found in the files you are already editing.)

# Ancient History
### What happened to Google code?
In mid-2014 ESAPI migrated all code and issues from Google Code to GitHub. This migration was completed in November 2014.

### What about the issues still located on Google Code?
All issues from Google Code have been migrated to GitHub issues. We now
use GitHut Issues for reporting everything *except* security vulnerabilities.
Other bug tracking sites are undoubtedly more advanced, but as developers,
we do not want to spent time having to close issues from multiple bug-tracking
systems. Therefore, until the synchronization happens with the Atlassian Jira
instance that we have (but are not using; see GitHub issue #371), please
ONLY use GitHub Issues for reporting bugs.

Previous release: ESAPI 2.6.1.0, 2025-05-19


Executive Summary: Important Things to Note for this Release
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a minor patch release with the intent of updating the Apache Commons BeanUtils dependency from v1.9.4 to v1.11.0 to CVE-2025-48734. This CVE wouuld only potentially affect application code that uses the ESAPI's AccessController component. It is extremently unlikely that anyone is using that because the default implmentation for that (the class "org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultAccessController") is really a toy implementation that doesn't scale to enterprise levels with out some customization. (The class "org.owasp.esapi.filters.ESAPIFilter" also uses "DefaultAccessController", but it is unlikely that anyone is using that either, unless they are using a customized AccessController implementation.) We plan to deprecate this ESAPI "DefaultAccessControler" shortly in a future release.

Notes if you are not updating from the immediate previous release. release 2.6.1.0:
    * You need to read through the series of release notes FIRST, going in order.
    * For example, if you were updating from an older ESAPI release (say, 2.3.0.0), you should go back and FIRST read all the subsequent release notes in turn. For instance, if you are currently on release 2.3.0.0 and upgrading to (say) release 2.x.y.z, you should MINIMALLY read the sections "Changes Requiring Special Attention" in each of the subsequent release notes. So, going from release 2.3.0.0 to 2.x.y.z, you should in turn, read:

    esapi4java-core-2.4.0.0-release-notes.txt
    esapi4java-core-2.5.0.0-release-notes.txt
    esapi4java-core-2.5.1.0-release-notes.txt
    esapi4java-core-2.5.2.0-release-notes.txt
    ...etc., up through the current set of release notes...
    esapi4java-core-2.x.y.z-release-notes.txt

in that order. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! (These release notes are too large to put all this in a given document; very few read them thoroughly as it is.)

If your SCA tool is reporting any CVE from a direct or transitive dependency in ESAPI, before reporting it as an GitHub issue, please make sure that you review the vulnerability analysis written up in https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/Vulnerability-Summary.md. Please email us or contact us in our GitHub Discussions page if you have questions about this. See also the SECURITY.md file to report any security issues with ESAPI.

Issue #         GitHub Issue Title
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
883             Update Apache Commons BeanUtils from 1.9.4 to 1.11.0 to address CVE-2025-48734

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Changes Requiring Special Attention

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important JDK Support Announcement
* ESAPI 2.3.0.0 was the last Java release to support Java 7. ESAPI 2.4.0 requires using Java 8 or later. See the ESAPI 2.4.0.0 release notes (https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.4.0.0-release-notes.txt) for details as to the reason.
    - This means if your project requires Java 7, you must use ESAPI 2.3.0.0 or earlier.

Important ESAPI Logging Changes

* Since ESAPI 2.5.0.0, support for logging directly via Log4J 1 has been removed. (This was two years after it haveing first been deprecated.) Thus, you only choice of ESAPI logging are
    - java.util.logging (JUL), which as been the default since ESAPI 2.2.1.0.
        * Set ESAPI.Logger=org.owasp.esapi.logging.java.JavaLogFactory in your ESAPI.properties file.
    - SLF4J (which your choice of supported SLF4J logging implemmentation)
        * Set ESAPI.Logger=org.owasp.esapi.logging.slf4j.Slf4JLogFactory in your ESAPI.properties file.
* Logger configuration notes - If you are migrating from prior to ESAPI 2.2.1.1, you will need to update your ESAPI.properties file as logging-related configuration as per the ESAPI 2.2.1.1 release notes, which may be found at:
    https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/esapi4java-core-2.2.1.1-release-notes.txt#L39-L78

If you use ESAPI 2.5.0.0 or later, you will get an ClassNotFoundException as the root cause if you still have your ESAPI.Logger property set to use Log4J because the org.owasp.esapi.logger.log4j.Log4JFactory class has been completely removed from the ESAPI jar.  If you are dead set on continuing to use Log4J 1, you ought to be able to do so via SLF4J. The set up for Log4J 1 (which has not be tested), should be similar to configure ESAPI to use SLF4J with Log4J 2 as described here:
    https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/wiki/Using-ESAPI-with-SLF4J#slf4j-using-log4j-2x

        Remaining Known Issues / Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
None known, other than the remaining open issues on GitHub.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Other changes in this release, some of which not tracked via GitHub issues

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Changes since last release 2.6.1.0 and 2.6.2.0, i.e., changes between 2025-05-19 and 2025-06-01).

    Note: I am no longer going to provide the 'Developer Activity Report' that I used to this manually create in tabluar form. This is in part because I use to use 'mvn site' to assist with its creation, but neither the 'Developer Activiity' nor 'File Activity' sections of the 'mvn site' output is currently working.

          That said, I don't care as this was always a major PITA and I think it had dubious value to start with.

          Therefore, I am replacing it to a stock GitHub tag comparison of the current and previous release, which I can automate.

    Please see,

        https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/compare/esapi-...esapi-2.6.2.0

    for details. It contains all the information that the previous 'Developer Activity Reports' did and then some.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGELOG:      Create your own. May I suggest:

        git log --stat --since=2025-05-19 --reverse --pretty=medium

    which will show all the commits since just after the previous (2.6.1.0) release.

    Alternately, you can download the most recent ESAPI source and run

        mvn site

    which will create a CHANGELOG file named 'target/site/changelog.html'

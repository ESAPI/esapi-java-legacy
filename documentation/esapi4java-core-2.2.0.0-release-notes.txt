Previous release: ESAPI 2.1.0.1, February 5, 2016


Executive Summary: Important Things to Note for this Release
------------------------------------------------------------
* Upgrade to require JDK 7 or later. JDK 6 is no longer supported by ESAPI.
* Upgrade to require Java Servlet API 3.0.1 or later. See "Appendix: Dependency Updates (as reflected in pom.xml)" below for additional details.
* 100+ GitHub issues closed. (Note: Includes previously incorrectly closed issues that were reopened, fixed, and then closed again.)
* Upgraded versions of several ESAPI dependencies (i.e., 3rd party jars), including several that had unpatched CVEs. See "Appendix: Dependency Updates (as reflected in pom.xml)" below for full details.
* Known vulnerabilities still not addressed:
    - There is this critical CVE in log4j 2.x before 2.8.2: CVE-2017-5645. It is a Java deserialization vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary remote code execution. Some private vulnerability databases claim that this same vulnerability is present in log4j 1.x even though the CVE itself does not claim that. However, examination of this CVE shows that the vulnerability is associated with implementations of TcpSocketServer and UdpSocketServer, which implement fully functional socket servers that can be used to listen on network connections and record log events sent to server from various client applications. For ESAPI to be vulnerable to that, first someone would have to have an implementation of wone of those servers running and secondly, they would have to change ESAPI's log4j.xml configuration file so that it uses log4j's SocketAppender rather than the default ConsoleAppender that ESAPI's default deployment uses. Thus even if this vulnerability were present in log4j 1.x, ESAPI's use of ConsoleAppender makes it a non-issue.
    - There is a known and unpatched vulnerability in the SLF4J Extensions that some vulnerability scanners may pick up and associate with ESAPI's use of slf4j-api-1.7.25.jar. (Note that OWASP Dependency Check does NOT flag this vulnerability [CVE-2018-8088], but others may.) According to NVD, this vulnerability is associated with "org.slf4j.ext.EventData in the slf4j-ext module in QOS.CH SLF4J before 1.8.0-beta2". Fortunately, I have confirmed that this Java deserialization does not impact ESAPI. First off, the default configuration of ESAPI.properties does not use SLF4J, but even if an application should choose to use it, ESAPI does not include the slf4j-ext jar and it has been confirmed that the vulnerable class (org.slf4j.ext.EventData) is not included in the slf4j-api jar that ESAPI does. Unfortunately, this CVE is not patched in the latest SLF4J packages, so even if we were to update it to latest version (currently 1.80-beta2, as of 12/31/2018), any scanners that associate ESAPI with CVE-2018-8088 would still have this false positive. But the important thing to ESAPI users is to know that if this CVE is identified for ESAPI, that it is a false positive.
    - Otherwise, ESAPI 2.2.0.0 addresses all know CVEs except for CVE-2013-5960 (which I have fixed in a private BitBucket repo, but getting it to be backward compatible is proving to be more difficult than anticipated.) Besides, if you want to use encryption in Java, I'd highly recommend using Google Tink, which is much more fully featured than ESAPI. (Tink allows key rotation, storing keys in various cloud HSMs, etc.)


It was mainly because of these first two bullet items above that we bumped the release to 2.2.0.0 rather than to 2.1.0.2. (See GitHub Issue #471 for details.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Changes requiring special attention

* Various deprecated methods were _actually_ deleted! This could break existing application code.

    442		Remove deprecated fields in Encoder interface

        Specifically, if you are using any of these previously deprecated fields from the Encoder interface, you need to update your application code to refer insteat to the constances from org.owasp.esapi.EncoderConstants:

                public final static char[] CHAR_LOWERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_LOWERS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_UPPERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_UPPERS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_DIGITS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_DIGITS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_SPECIALS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_SPECIALS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_LETTERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_LETTERS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_ALPHANUMERICS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_ALPHANUMERICS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_PASSWORD_LOWERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_PASSWORD_LOWERS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_PASSWORD_UPPERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_PASSWORD_UPPERS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_PASSWORD_DIGITS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_PASSWORD_DIGITS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_PASSWORD_SPECIALS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_PASSWORD_SPECIALS;
                public final static char[] CHAR_PASSWORD_LETTERS = EncoderConstants.CHAR_PASSWORD_LETTERS;

    444		Delete deprecated method Base64.decodeToObject() and related methods

        Specifically, the following methods were removed from the org.owasp.esapi.codecs.Base64 class. If you will using any of these methods, you likely already had vulnerabilities in your application code. If any of these methods were being used, you will need to rewrite your application code:

                public static String encodeObject( java.io.Serializable serializableObject )
                public static String encodeObject( java.io.Serializable serializableObject, int options )
                public static Object decodeToObject( String encodedObject )

    483     More miscellaneous prep work for ESAPI 2.2.0.0 release
        Specifically, CipherText.getSerialVersionUID() and DefaultSecurityConfiguration.MAX_FILE_NAME_LENGTH have actually been deleted from the ESAPI code base. For the former, use CipherText.cipherTextVersion() instead. For the latter, there is no replacement. (This wasn't being used, but it was set to 1000 in case you're wondering.)
        
* Various properties in ESAPI.properties were changed in a way that might affect your application:
    439		Tighten ESAPI defaults to disallow dubious file suffixes

        Specifically, the property HttpUtilities.ApprovedUploadExtensions changed from
            HttpUtilities.ApprovedUploadExtensions=.zip,.pdf,.doc,.docx,.ppt,.pptx,.tar,.gz,.tgz,.rar,.war,.jar,.ear,.xls,.rtf,.properties,.java,.class,.txt,.xml,.jsp,.jsf,.exe,.dll
        to:
            HttpUtilities.ApprovedUploadExtensions=.pdf,.doc,.docx,.ppt,.pptx,.xls,.xlsx,.rtf,.txt,.jpg,.png
        so if you were relying on your application to legimately accept an of the dangerous file types that were removed, you will need to update this property in your application's ESAPI.properties file accordingly.

    - Several other properties related to the ESAPI Validator interface (typically through one of the isValid() methods) have had their default values which it uses modified. This mostly affects the use ESAPI.validator().isValid() calls, use of the class org.owasp.esapi.filters.SecurityWrapperRequest (which extends HttpServletRequestWrapper and is often used separately), as well as the ESAPI servlet filter, org.owasp.esapi.filters.SecurityWrapper, that uses it SecurityWrapperRequest. The following ESAPI properties are affected. If you are relying on any of these properties, you should review your application to see if / how it might be impacted.

            Validator.HTTPContextPath:      Changed so that '/' is no longer a valid character.
            Validator.HTTPHeaderName:       Changed so that the max size of a valid HTTP header name increased from 50 to 256.
            Validator.HTTPJSESSIONID:       Changed so that valid HTTP JSESSIONID length increased from 30 to 32 characters.
            Validator.HTTPParameterName:    Changed so that '-' is now considered a valid character for an HTTP parameter name.
            Validator.HTTPParameterValue:   Changed so that some additional characters are allowed and length is limited to 1000 characters; i.e., changed from:
                                                    Validator.HTTPParameterValue=^[a-zA-Z0-9.\\-\\/+=@_ ]*$
                                                to:
                                                    Validator.HTTPParameterValue=^[\\p{L}\\p{N}.\\-/+=_ !$*?@]{0,1000}$
            Validator.HTTPQueryString:      Changed lots of things. Specifically, changed from:
                                                    Validator.HTTPQueryString=^[a-zA-Z0-9()\\-=\\*\\.\\?;,+\\/:&_ %]*$
                                                to:
                                                    Validator.HTTPQueryString=^([a-zA-Z0-9_\\-]{1,32}=[\\p{L}\\p{N}.\\-/+=_ !$*?@%]*&?)*$
                                                (Left as an exercise for the reader to figure out what exactly this means. ;-)
            Validator.HTTPURI:              Changed to be much more restrictive; i.e., changed from:
                                                    Validator.HTTPURI=^[a-zA-Z0-9()\\-=\\*\\.\\?;,+\\/:&_ ]*$ 
                                                to:
                                                    Validator.HTTPURI=^/([a-zA-Z0-9.\\-_]*/?)*$
            

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Other changes in this release, some of which not tracked via GitHub issues

* Updated minimal version of Maven from 3.0 to 3.1 required to build ESAPI. 
* Miscellaneous minor javadoc fixes and updates.
* Added the Maven plug-in for OWASP Dependency Check so 3rd party dependencies can be kept up-to-date.
* Updated .gitignore file with additional files to be ignored.
* Changed many additional assertions in ESAPI crypto to explicit runtime checks that throw IllegalArgumentException instead. If you were using ESAPI crypto correctly, it shouldn't affect you, but if you were calling it incorrectly, you may now immediately get an IllegalArgumentException rather than something like a mysterious MullPointerException much later on.

Thanks you all for your time and effort to ESAPI and making it a better project.

Appendix:   Dependency Updates (as reflected in pom.xml)


Many 3rd party dependencies had known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs reported to NIST's NVD, those reported via VulnDB, BlackDuck, SourceClear, etc.). We have tried to address all those of which we were aware and have updated the dependent 3rd party libraries to (where possible) the latest patched version.

Note that in many places, these 3rd party dependencies were not *direct* dependencies, but rather *transitive* and since we are not able to force a direct 3rd party dependency to update their dependencies, in several cases, we have used Maven's <exclusions> tag to exclude specific transitive dependencies andthen explictly included their latest patched versions that did not cause JUnit test failures.

Because the landscape of known vulnerabilities in 3rd party components is constantly changing and the OWASP ESAPI contributors do not have access to all private vulnerability databases, we may have inevitably missed some. In other cases, we have examined reported vulnerabilities and confirmed that as ESAPI uses and deploys the code in its default configuration, the claimed vulnerabilities are not exploitable.

The following lists all new and updated dependencies. If a dependency is not listed below, the version used since ESAPI release 2.1.0.1 has not changed.

New compile-time / runtime direct dependencies:
    org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.25 - Not actually needed in your application's classpath unless ESAPI.Logger is configured to use org.owasp.esapi.logging.slf4j.Slf4JLogFactory.

New JUnit dependencies
    org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.61
    org.powermock:powermock-api-mockito2:2.0.0-beta.5
    org.powermock:powermock-module-junit4:2.0.0-beta.5

Updated direct dependencies, by Maven scope
  provided:
    javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:            2.5   -> 3.0.1
    javax.servlet.jsp:javax.servlet.jsp-api:    2.0   -> 2.3.3

  compile:
    commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload:      1.3.1 -> 1.3.3
    org.apache.commons:commons-collections4:    3.2.2 -> 4.3
    commons-beanutils:commons-beanutils-core:   1.8.3 -> 1.9.3
    com.io7m.xom:xom:                           1.2.5 -> 1.2.10
    org.apache-extras.beanshell:bsh:            2.0b4 -> 2.0b6
    org.owasp.antisamy:antisamy:                1.5.3 -> 1.5.8
    org.apache.xmlgraphics:batik-css:           1.8   -> 1.11

    Transitive runtime dependencies that ESAPI has now directly taken control off because of known vulnerabilities or other incompatibilities:
        xalan:xalan:                            2.7.0 -> 2.7.2
        xml-apis:xml-apis:                     1.3.03 -> 1.4.01
        xerces:xercesImpl:                      2.8.0 -> 2.12.0

  test:
    commons-io:commons-io:                      2.4   -> 2.6

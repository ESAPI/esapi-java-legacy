README  - This file you are now reading.
java    - Some Java examples.
scripts - Some scripts to run that interact with the Java examples (but see
          below). Purpose of script generally described at the beginning of
          the file as a comment.



NOTE:   All scripts are meant to be run under *nix (or using something like
        Cygwin or WSL under Windows) from under the 'scripts' directory using either
        bash or KornShell

        E.g., to compile the Java examples, execute:

                $ cd scripts
                $ chmod u+x *.sh    # Required as some call each other.
                $ # "Dot" the appropriate environment file. Either
                $ #     . ./setenv-zip.sh
                $ # if ESAPI downloaded via zip file or
                $ #     . ./setenv-git.sh
                $ # if ESAPI downloaded from a Git or Svn repository. For the
                $ # example of this README file, we will assume it was
                $ # downloaded via the zip file.
                $ . ./setenv-zip.sh
                $ sh ./compile.sh

        You MUST be in the 'scripts' directory and execute the scripts as
        "sh ./scriptname" and NOT as "sh scripts/scriptname".


        Note that as delivered, these scripts are configured to run from
        Eclipse or Maven as pulled directly from the ESAPI GitHub
        repository or from pulled down from the zip file on GitHub at:
            https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip

        If you get it from any other place, then all bets are off.

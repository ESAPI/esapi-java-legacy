################## NEW PROPERTIES ################### 
#
#   NOTE: I still like the property name
#       ESAPI.enableLegCannonModeAndGetMyAssFired.methodNames"
#   and
#       ESAPI.enableLegCannonModeAndGetMyAssFired.methodNames"
#   better. Betcha those would be set a lot less often than this "more
#   professional" names will be.
#
########################################################################################
# The following methods are now disabled in the default configuration and must
# be explicity enabled. If you try to invoke a method disabled by default, ESAPI
# will thrown a NotConfiguredByDefaultException.
#
# The reason for this varies, but ranges from they are not really suitable for
# enterprise scale to that are only marginally tested (if at all) versus the are
# unsafe for general use, although them may be fine when combined with other
# security-in-depth techiques.
#
# The disabled-by-default methods are:
#   org.owasp.esapi.reference.DefaultEncoder.encodeForSQL
#   org.owasp.esapi.ESAPI.accessController  [FUTURE; will correspond to deprecation notice]
#
# The format is a comma-separated list of fully.Qualified.ClassName.methodName;
# all class names must begin with "org.owasp.esapi.".

# Normally you would put some text here (that will be logged) that provides some
# justification as to why you have enabled these functions. This can be
# anythuing such as a Jira or ServiceNow ticket number, a security exception
# reference, etc. If it is left empty, it will just like "Justification: none".`

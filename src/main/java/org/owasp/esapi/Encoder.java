/**
 * The {@code Encoder} interface contains a number of methods for decoding input and encoding output
 * so that it will be safe for a variety of interpreters. Its primary use is to
 * provide <i>output</i> encoding to prevent XSS.
 * <p>
 * To prevent double-encoding, callers should make sure input does not already contain encoded characters
 * by calling one of the {@code canonicalize()} methods. Validator implementations should call
 * {@code canonicalize()} on user input <b>before</b> validating to prevent encoded attacks.
 * </p><p>
 * All of the methods <b>must</b> use an "allow list" or "positive" security model rather
 * than a "deny list" or "negative" security model.  For the encoding methods, this means that
 * all characters should be encoded, except for a specific list of "immune" characters that are
 * known to be safe.
 * </p><p>
 * The {@code Encoder} performs two key functions, encoding (also referred to as "escaping" in this Javadoc)
 * and decoding. These functions rely on a set of codecs that can be found in the
 * {@code org.owasp.esapi.codecs} package. These include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>CSS Escaping</li>
 * <li>HTMLEntity Encoding</li>
 * <li>JavaScript Escaping</li>
 * <li>MySQL Database Escaping</li>
 * <li>Oracle Database Escaping</li>
 * <li>Percent Encoding (aka URL Encoding)</li>
 * <li>Unix Shell Escaping</li>
 * <li>VBScript Escaping</li>
 * <li>Windows Cmd Escaping</li>
 * <li>LDAP Escaping</li>
 * <li>XML and XML Attribute Encoding</li>
 * <li>XPath Escaping</li>
 * <li>Base64 Encoding</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p><p>
 * The primary use of ESAPI {@code Encoder} is to prevent XSS vulnerabilities by
 * providing output encoding using the various "encodeFor<i>XYZ</i>()" methods,
 * where <i>XYZ</i> is one of CSS, HTML, HTMLAttribute, JavaScript, or URL. When
 * using the ESAPI output encoders, it is important that you use the one for the
 * <b>appropriate context</b> where the output will be rendered. For example, it
 * the output appears in an JavaScript context, you should use {@code encodeForJavaScript}
 * (note this includes all of the DOM JavaScript event handler attributes such as
 * 'onfocus', 'onclick', 'onload', etc.). If the output would be rendered in an HTML
 * attribute context (with the exception of the aforementioned 'onevent' type event
 * handler attributes), you would use {@code encodeForHTMLAttribute}. If you are
 * encoding anywhere a URL is expected (e.g., a 'href' attribute for for &lt;a&gt; or
 * a 'src' attribute on a &lt;img&gt; tag, etc.), then you should use use {@code encodeForURL}.
 * If encoding CSS, then use {@code encodeForCSS}. Etc. This is because there are
 * different escaping requirements for these different contexts. Developers who are
 * new to ESAPI or to defending against XSS vulnerabilities are highly encouraged to
 * <i>first</i> read the
 * <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferreer">
 * OWASP Cross-Site Scripting Prevention Cheat Sheet</a>.
 * </p><p>
 * Note that in addition to these encoder methods, ESAPI also provides a JSP Tag
 * Library ({@code META-INF/esapi.tld}) in the ESAPI jar. This allows one to use
 * the more convenient JSP tags in JSPs. These JSP tags are simply wrappers for the
 * various these "encodeForX<i>XYZ</i>()" method docmented in this {@code Encoder}
 * interface.
 * </p><p>
 * <b>Some important final words:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Where to output encode for HTML rendering:</b>
 * Knowing <i>where</i> to place the output encoding in your code
 * is just as important as knowing which context (HTML, HTML attribute, CSS,
 * JavaScript, or URL) to use for the output encoding and surprisingly the two
 * are often related. In general, output encoding should be done just prior to the
 * output being rendered (that is, as close to the 'sink' as possible) because that
 * is what determines what the appropriate context is for the output encoding.
 * In fact, doing output encoding on untrusted data that is stored and to
 * be used later--whether stored in an HTTP session or in a database--is almost
 * always considered an anti-pattern. An example of this is one gathers and
 * stores some untrusted data item such as an email address from a user. A
 * developer thinks "let's output encode this and store the encoded data in
 * the database, thus making the untrusted data safe to use all the time, thus
* saving all of us developers all the encoding troubles later on". On the surface,
 * that sounds like a reasonable approach. The problem is how to know what
 * output encoding to use, not only for now, but for all possible <i>future</i>
 * uses? It might be that the current application code base is only using it in
 * an HTML context that is displayed in an HTML report or shown in an HTML
 * context in the user's profile. But what if it is later used in a {@code mailto:} URL?
 * Then instead of HTML encoding, it would need to have URL encoding. Similarly,
 * what if there is a later switch made to use AJAX and the untrusted email
 * address gets used in a JavaScript context? The complication is that even if
 * you know with certainty today all the ways that an untrusted data item is
 * used in your application, it is generally impossible to predict all the
 * contexts that it may be used in the future, not only in your application, but
 * in other applications that could access that data in the database.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Avoiding multiple <i>nested</i> contexts:</b>
 * A really tricky situation to get correct is when there are multiple nested
 * encoding contexts. But far, the most common place this seems to come up is
 * untrusted URLs used in JavaScript. How should you handle that? Well,
 * the best way is to rewrite your code to avoid it!  An example of
 * this that is well worth reading may be found at
 * <a href="https://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/esapi-dev/2012-March/002090"
 * target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESAPI-DEV mailing list archives:
 * URL encoding within JavaScript</a>. Be sure to read the entire thread.
 * The question itself is too nuanced to be answered in Javadoc, but now,
 * hopefully you are at least aware of the potential pitfalls. There is little
 * available research or examples on how to do output encoding when multiple
 * mixed encodings are required, although one that you may find useful is
 * <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01862.pdf" target="_blank"
 * rel="noopener noreferrer">
 * Automated Detecting and Repair of Cross-SiteScripting Vulnerabilities through Unit Testing</a>
 * It at least discusses a few of the common errors involved in multiple mixed
 * encoding contexts.
 * </li><li><b>A word about unit testing:</b>
 * Unit testing this is hard. You may be satisfied with stopped after you have
 * tested against the ubiquitous XSS test case of
 * <pre>
 *      &lt;/script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;
 * </pre>
 * or similar simplistic XSS attack payloads and if that is properly encoded
 * (or, you don't see an alert box popped in your browser), you consider it
 * "problem fixed", and consider the unit testing sufficient. Unfortunately, that
 * minimalist testing may not always detect places where you used the wrong output
 * encoder. You need to do better. Fortunately, the aforementioned link,
 * <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.01862.pdf" target="_blank"

    /**
     * Canonicalization is simply the operation of reducing a possibly encoded
     * string down to its simplest form. This is important, because attackers
     * frequently use encoding to change their input in a way that will bypass
     * validation filters, but still be interpreted properly by the target of
     * the attack. Note that data encoded more than once is not something that a
     * normal user would generate and should be regarded as an attack.
     * <p>
     * Everyone <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/180.html">says</a> you shouldn't do validation
     * without canonicalizing the data first. This is easier said than done. The canonicalize method can
     * be used to simplify just about any input down to its most basic form. Note that canonicalize doesn't
     * handle Unicode issues, it focuses on higher level encoding and escaping schemes. In addition to simple
     * decoding, canonicalize also handles:
     * <ul><li>Perverse but legal variants of escaping schemes</li>
     * <li>Multiple escaping (%2526 or &#x26;lt;)</li>
     * <li>Mixed escaping (%26lt;)</li>
     * <li>Nested escaping (%%316 or &%6ct;)</li>
     * <li>All combinations of multiple, mixed, and nested encoding/escaping (%2&#x35;3c or &#x2526gt;)</li></ul>
     * <p>
     * Using canonicalize is simple. The default is just...
     * <pre>
     *     String clean = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter("input"));
     * </pre>
     * You need to decode untrusted data so that it's safe for ANY downstream interpreter or decoder. For
     * example, if your data goes into a Windows command shell, then into a database, and then to a browser,
     * you're going to need to decode for all of those systems. You can build a custom encoder to canonicalize
     * for your application like this...
     * <pre>
     *     ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
     *     list.add( new WindowsCodec() );
     *     list.add( new MySQLCodec() );
     *     list.add( new PercentCodec() );
     *     Encoder encoder = new DefaultEncoder( list );
     *     String clean = encoder.canonicalize( request.getParameter( "input" ));
     * </pre>
     * In ESAPI, the Validator uses the canonicalize method before it does validation.  So all you need to
     * do is to validate as normal and you'll be protected against a host of encoded attacks.
     * <pre>
     *     String input = request.getParameter( "name" );
     *     String name = ESAPI.validator().isValidInput( "test", input, "FirstName", 20, false);
     * </pre>
     * However, the default canonicalize() method only decodes HTMLEntity, percent (URL) encoding, and JavaScript
     * encoding. If you'd like to use a custom canonicalizer with your validator, that's pretty easy too.
     * <pre>
     *     ... setup custom encoder as above
     *     Validator validator = new DefaultValidator( encoder );
     *     String input = request.getParameter( "name" );
     *     String name = validator.isValidInput( "test", input, "name", 20, false);
     * </pre>
     * Although ESAPI is able to canonicalize multiple, mixed, or nested encoding, it's safer to not accept
     * this stuff in the first place. In ESAPI, the default is "strict" mode that throws an IntrusionException
     * if it receives anything not single-encoded with a single scheme. This is configurable
     * in {@code ESAPI.properties} using the properties:
     * <pre>
     * Encoder.AllowMultipleEncoding=false
     * Encoder.AllowMixedEncoding=false
     * </pre>
     * This method allows you to override the default behavior by directly specifying whether to restrict
     * multiple or mixed encoding. Even if you disable restrictions, you'll still get
     * warning messages in the log about each multiple encoding and mixed encoding received.
     * <pre>
     *     // disabling strict mode to allow mixed encoding
     *     String url = ESAPI.encoder().canonicalize( request.getParameter("url"), false, false);
     * </pre>
     * <b>WARNING!!!</b> Please note that this method is incompatible with URLs and if there exist any HTML Entities
     * that correspond with parameter values in a URL such as "&amp;para;" in a URL like 
     * "https://foo.com/?bar=foo&amp;parameter=wrong" you will get a mixed encoding validation exception.
     * <p>
     * If you wish to canonicalize a URL/URI use the method {@code Encoder.getCanonicalizedURI(URI dirtyUri);}

The "parameterstocommand" should of course be validated before passing them to the OS command.

The ESAPI interfaces and {@code Exception} classes model the most
important security functions to enterprise web applications.
The interfaces in this package are intended to be extended and
customized within an enterprise to match their custom data,
security services, and application environment. A reference
implementation of this interface is provided as an example of how this
library can be implemented successfully, but is useful in many ways
by itself as well.
<p>
OWASP ESAPI interfaces and reference implementation provides
enterprise web application developers with the most important
security functions they need in ordre to build secure web applications
and web services that stand up to most common-day web-based attacks.

make application security "visible," so that people and organizations
can make informed decisions about application security risks. Everyone

<h2>ESAPI Architecture</h2>

<p>The ESAPI class library builds on the excellent security libraries available,
such as Java Logging, JCE, and Apache Commons FileUpload. It uses the
concepts from many of the security packages out there, such as Spring Security,
Apache Commons Validator, Microsoft's AntiXSS library, and many many
more. This library provides a single consistent interface to security
functions that is intuitive for enterprise developers.</p>

<h2>Addressing OWASP Top Ten</h2>

<p>Used properly, the ESAPI provides enough functions to protect
against most of the
<a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project">
OWASP Top Ten</a>.  The only real exception is the
Insecure Communications category, which is generally outside the control
of the software developer.</p>

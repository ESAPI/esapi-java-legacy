This package contains codecs for application layer encoding/escaping schemes that can be used for
both canonicalization and output encoding. By using the codecs to decode (canonicalize) input
before validation, many attacks can be detected and handled.  By using the codecs to encode
untrusted data before sending it to an interpreter, a wide variety of 'injection' attacks can
be stopped. However,
this package does not currently address issues related to converting between byte-streams and
internal character representations, such as overlong UTF-8 issues. Those are left to the platform.
The codecs cover protocol encodings such as HTML entity encoding and percent encoding, but also
common product escaping schemes, such as Unix, Windows, MySQL, and Oracle.

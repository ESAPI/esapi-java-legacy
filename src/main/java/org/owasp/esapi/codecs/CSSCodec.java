		/* From css 2.1 spec:
		 * http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#characters
		 *
		 * First, inside a string, a backslash followed by a
		 * newline is ignored (i.e., the string is deemed not
		 * to contain either the backslash or the newline).
		 *
		 * Second, it cancels the meaning of special CSS
		 * characters. Except within CSS comments, any character
		 * (except a hexadecimal digit, linefeed, carriage return,
		 * or form feed) can be escaped with a backslash to
		 * remove its special meaning. For example, "\"" is a string
		 * consisting of one double quote. Style sheet
		 * preprocessors must not remove these backslashes
		 * from a style sheet since that would change the style
		 * sheet's meaning.
		 *
		 * Third, backslash escapes allow authors to refer to
		 * characters they cannot easily put in a document. In
		 * this case, the backslash is followed by at most six
		 * hexadecimal digits (0..9A..F), which stand for the ISO
		 * 10646 ([ISO10646]) character with that number, which
		 * must not be zero. (It is undefined in CSS 2.1 what
		 * happens if a style sheet does contain a character with
		 * Unicode codepoint zero.) If a character in the range
		 * [0-9a-fA-F] follows the hexadecimal number, the end
		 * of the number needs to be made clear. There are two
		 * ways to do that:
		 *
		 *	1. with a space (or other white space character):
		 *	"\26 B" ("&B"). In this case, user agents should
		 *	treat a "CR/LF" pair (U+000D/U+000A) as a single
		 *	white space character.
		 *
		 *	2. by providing exactly 6 hexadecimal digits:
		 *	"\000026B" ("&B")
		 *
		 * In fact, these two methods may be combined. Only one
		 * white space character is ignored after a hexadecimal
		 * escape. Note that this means that a "real" space
		 * after the escape sequence must itself either be
		 * escaped or doubled.
		 *
		 * If the number is outside the range allowed by Unicode
		 * (e.g., "\110000" is above the maximum 10FFFF allowed in
		 * current Unicode), the UA may replace the escape with
		 * the "replacement character" (U+FFFD). If the character
		 * is to be displayed, the UA should show a visible
		 * symbol, such as a "missing character" glyph (cf. 15.2,
		 * point 5).

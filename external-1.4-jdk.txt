Using a External 1.4 JDK with Maven
-----------------------------------

As ESAPI4J 1.4 is targeting Java 1.4 it is good to build and run tests
with a 1.4 JDK. This poses some problems with Maven though as current
versions of Maven require at least Java 1.5 (5.0 in Sun marketing
speak). There are two possible solutions: run a older version of Maven
which will run under 1.4 (untested) or have Maven call a external 1.4
JDK for compilation and testing. This file explains the latter choice.

pom.xml
-------

In the pom.xml, there are two commented out sections for calling
an external 1.4 JDK. The first is the configuration for the
maven-compiler-plugin. Uncomment the following options:

<fork>true</fork>
<executable>${jdk-14-home}/bin/javac</executable>
<compilerVersion>1.4</compilerVersion>

The fork option tells Maven to run the compiler in a separate process. The
executable option sets the path to the javac binary. Finally, the
compilerVersion option tells Maven that the compiler is a version 1.4
compiler.

The example above (and in the commented out section in pom.xml) assumes
that the system property jdk-14-home has the path to the 1.4 JDK you wish
to use. See the following section on settings.xml for one way to set this.

The other pom.xml section that needs uncommented is the configuration
for the maven-surefire-plugin:

<jvm>${jdk-14-home}/bin/java</jvm>

This configures the surefire plugin, which handles the unit tests,
to call an external JVM to run the unit tests. In this case, the jvm
option sets the path to the java binary. Again, this assumes that you
have the jdk-14-home system property set.

jdk-14-home System Property
---------------------------

There are several ways to set a system property for Maven. The easiest is to just specify one on the command line:

mvn -Djdk-14-home=/path/to/j2sdk1.4 test

A more convinent method is to set the property via a profile in your Maven settings.xml. Here is a example of a settings.xml that does just that:


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="US-ASCII"?>

<settings>
	<profiles>
		<profile>
			<id>compiler</id>
			<properties>
				<jdk-14-home>/path/to/j2sdk1.4/</jdk-14-home>
			</properties>
		</profile>
	</profiles>
	<activeProfiles>
		<activeProfile>compiler</activeProfile>
	</activeProfiles>
</settings>

If you're settings.xml does not already exist (the default), you may
need to create one.

The settings.xml file is located in the .m2 directory of your home
directory on *nix and in c:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\.m2 (or the
like) on windows.

Once these options are set in your settings.xml, you should be able to
just run Maven as usual and the 1.4 JDK will be used.

Executive Summary: Important Things to Note for this Release
------------------------------------------------------------
@@@@ View previous release notes to see examples of what to put here. This is typical. YMMV.
This is a patch release with the primary intent of updating some dependencies, some with known vulnerabilities. Details follow.

For those of you using a Software Configuration Analysis (SCA) services such as Snyk, BlackDuck, Veracode SourceClear, OWASP Dependency Check, etc., you might notice that there is vulnerability in xerces:xercesImpl:2.12.0 that ESAPI uses (also a transitive dependency) that is similar to CVE-2020-14621. Unfortunately there is no official patch for this in the regular Maven Central repository. Further details are described in Security Bulletin #3, which is viewable here
   https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin3.pdf 
and associated with this release on GitHub. Manual workarounds possible. See the security bulletin for further details.

        Changes Requiring Special Attention

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
@@@@ NOTE any special notes here. Probably leave this one, but I would suggest noting additions BEFORE this.
[If you have already successfully been using ESAPI 2.2.1.0 or later, you probably can skip this section.]

Since ESAPI 2.2.1.0, the new default ESAPI logger is JUL (java.util.logging packages) and we have deprecated the use of Log4J 1.x because we now support SLF4J and Log4J 1.x is way past its end-of-life. We did not want to make SLF4J the default logger (at least not yet) as we did not want to have the default ESAPI use require additional dependencies. However, SLF4J is likely to be the future choice, at least once we start on ESAPI 3.0. A special shout-out to Jeremiah Stacey for making this possible by re-factoring much of the ESAPI logger code. Note, the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back was the announcement of CVE-2019-17571 (rated Critical), for which there is no fix available and likely will never be.

However, if you try to juse the new ESAPI 2.2.1.0 or later logging you will notice that you need to change ESAPI.Logger and also possibly provide some other properties as well to get the logging behavior that you desire.

To use ESAPI logging in ESAPI 2.2.1.0 (and later), you will need to set the ESAPI.Logger property to

    org.owasp.esapi.logging.java.JavaLogFactory     - To use the new default, java.util.logging (JUL)
    org.owasp.esapi.logging.log4j.Log4JLogFactory   - To use the end-of-life Log4J 1.x logger
    org.owasp.esapi.logging.slf4j.Slf4JLogFactory   - To use the new (to release 2.2.0.0) SLF4J logger

In addition, if you wish to use JUL for logging, you *MUST* supply an "esapi-java-logging.properties" file in your classpath. This file is included in the 'esapi-2.2.2.0-configuration.jar' file provided under the 'Assets' section of the GitHub Release at
    https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/releases/esapi-2.2.2.0

Unfortunately, there was a logic error in the static initializer of JavaLogFactory (now fixed in this release) that caused a NullPointerException to be thrown so that the message about the missing "esapi-java-logging.properties" file was never seen.

If you are using JavaLogFactory, you will also want to ensure that you have the following ESAPI logging properties set:
    # Set the application name if these logs are combined with other applications
    Logger.ApplicationName=ExampleApplication
    # If you use an HTML log viewer that does not properly HTML escape log data, you can set LogEncodingRequired to true
    Logger.LogEncodingRequired=false
    # Determines whether ESAPI should log the application name. This might be clutter in some single-server/single-app environments.
    Logger.LogApplicationName=true
    # Determines whether ESAPI should log the server IP and port. This might be clutter in some single-server environments.
    Logger.LogServerIP=true
    # LogFileName, the name of the logging file. Provide a full directory path (e.g., C:\\ESAPI\\ESAPI_logging_file) if you
    # want to place it in a specific directory.
    Logger.LogFileName=ESAPI_logging_file
    # MaxLogFileSize, the max size (in bytes) of a single log file before it cuts over to a new one (default is 10,000,000)
    Logger.MaxLogFileSize=10000000
    # Determines whether ESAPI should log the user info.
    Logger.UserInfo=true
    # Determines whether ESAPI should log the session id and client IP.
    Logger.ClientInfo=true

See GitHub issue #560 for additional details.


Related to that aforemented Log4J 1.x CVE and how it affects ESAPI, be sure to read
   https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin2.pdf 
which describes CVE-2019-17571, a deserialization vulnerability in Log4J 1.2.17. ESAPI is *NOT* affected by this (even if you chose to use Log4J 1 as you default ESAPI logger). This security bulletin describes why this CVE is not exploitable as used by ESAPI.


Finally, while ESAPI still supports JDK 7 (even though that too is way past end-of-life), the next ESAPI release will move to JDK 8 as the minimal baseline. (We already use Java 8 for development but still to Java 7 source and runtime compatibility.) We need to do this out of necessity because some of our dependencies are no longer doing updates that support Java 7.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Remaining Known Issues / Problems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you use Java 7 (the minimal Java baseline supported by ESAPI) and try to run 'mvn test' there is one test that fails. This test passes with Java 8. The failing test is:

        [ERROR] Tests run: 5, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.203 s
        <<< FAILURE! - in org.owasp.esapi.crypto.SecurityProviderLoaderTest
        [ERROR] org.owasp.esapi.crypto.SecurityProviderLoaderTest.testWithBouncyCastle
        Time elapsed: 0.116 s <<< FAILURE!
        java.lang.AssertionError: Encryption w/ Bouncy Castle failed with
        EncryptionException for preferred cipher transformation; exception was:
        org.owasp.esapi.errors.EncryptionException: Encryption failure (unavailable
        cipher requested)
        at
        org.owasp.esapi.crypto.SecurityProviderLoaderTest.testWithBouncyCastle(Security
        ProviderLoaderTest.java:133)

I will spare you all the details and tell you that this has to do with Java 7 not being able to correctly parse the signed Bouncy Castle JCE provider jar. More details are available at:
    https://www.bouncycastle.org/latest_releases.html
and
    https://github.com/bcgit/bc-java/issues/477
I am sure that there are ways of making Bouncy Castle work with Java 7, but since ESAPI does not rely on Bouncy Castle (it can use any compliant JCE provider), this should not be a problem. (It works fine with the default SunJCE provider.) If it is important to get the BC provider working with the ESAPI Encryptor and Java 7, then open a GitHub issue and we will take a deeper look at it and see if we can suggest something.



Another problem is if you run 'mvn test' from the 'cmd' prompt (and possibly PowerShell as well), you will get intermittent failures (generally between 10-25% of the time) at arbitrary spots. If you run it again without any changes it will work fine without any failures. We have discovered that it doesn't seem to fail if you run the tests from an IDE like Eclipse or if you redirect both stdout and stderr to a file; e.g.,

    C:\code\esapi-java-legacy> mvn test >testoutput.txt 2>&1

We believe these failures is because the maven-surefire-plugin is by default not forking a new JVM process for each test class. We are looking into this. For now, we have only have observed this behavior on Windows 10. If you see this error, please do NOT report it as a GitHub issue unless you know a fix for it. (And yes, we are aware of '<reuseForks>false</reuseForks>' in the pom for the maven-surefire-plugin, but that causes other tests to fail that we haven't had time to fix.)


Lastly, some SCA services may continue to flag vulnerabilties in ESAPI ${VERSION} related to log4j 1.2.17 (e.g., CVE-2020-9488). We do not believe the way that ESAPI uses log4j in a manner that leads to any exploitable behavior.  See the security bulletins
   https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/documentation/ESAPI-security-bulletin2.pdf 
for additional details.

There were also several snyk-bot PRs that were rejected for various reasons, mostly because 1) I was already making the proposed changes and preferred to do them in single commit or 2) there were other reasons for rejecting them (such as the dependency requiring Java 8). The proposed changes that were not outright rejected were included as part of commit a8a79bc5196653500ce664b7b063284e60bddaa0.

CHANGELOG:      Create your own. May I suggest:

        git log --stat --since=${PREV_RELEASE_DATE} --reverse --pretty=medium

    which will show all the commits since just after the previous (${PREV_VERSION}) release.

                        Contributing to ESAPI

Getting Started:
    If you have not already done so, go back and read the section
    "Contributing to ESAPI legacy" in ESAPI's README.md file. It
    make contain updates and advice not contained herein.

Finding Something Interesting to Work on:

    See the section "Contributing to ESAPI legacy in
    https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/blob/develop/README.md
    While you don't *have* to work on something labeled "good first issue"
    or "help wanted", those are good places to start for someone not yet
    familiar with the ESAPI code base.

    You will need a account on GitHub though. Once you create one, let me know
    what it is. Then if you want to work on a particular issue, we can assign
    it to you so someone else won't take it.

    If you have questions, email me or Matt Seil (xeno6696@gmail.com).

Overview:
    We are following the branching model described in
        https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model
    If you are unfamiliar with it, you would be advised to give it a
    quick perusal. The major point is that the 'master' branch is reserved for
    official releases (which will be tagged), the 'develop' branch is used for
    ongoing development work and is the default branch, and we generally work
    off 'issue' branches named 'issue-#' where # is the GitHub issue number.
    (The last is not an absolute requirement, but rather a suggested
    approach.)

    Finally, we recommend setting the git property 'core.autocrlf' to 'input'
    in your $HOME/.gitconfig file; e.g., that file should contain something
    like this:

        [core]
            autocrlf = input

Required Software:
    We use Maven for building. Maven 3.1 or later is required. You also need
    JDK 7 or later. (We generally use JDK 8, but compile ESAPI only to require
    JDK 7, which means our code can't yet use any features exclusive to Java 8
    or later.)

Building ESAPI:
    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI-Building briefly discusses how to
    build ESAPI via Maven.

    Also https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy/wiki/Using-ESAPI-for-Java-with-Eclipse
    describes how to use ESAPI with Eclipse and
    https://www.owasp.org/index.php/ESAPI-BuildingWithEclipse is a very old
    overview of how to build ESAPI in Eclipse.

    As always, any contributions to ESAPI's admittedly skimpy documentation
    in this area is welcome.

Steps to work with ESAPI:
    I usually do everything from the bash command prompt in Linux Mint,
    but other people use Windows. If you prefer an IDE, I can't help you
    much, but I can help with at least modest problems. If you have more
    difficult problems, I will probably refer you to my project co-leader,
    Matt who groks git a lot better than I.

    But the basic high level steps are:
    1. Fork https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy to your own GitHub
       repository.
    2. On your local laptop, clone your own GitHub ESAPI repo (i.e, the
       forked repo created in previous step)
    3. Create a new branch to work on an issue. I usually name the branch
       'issue-#' where '#' is the GitHub issue # is will be working on, but
       you can call it whatever. E.g.,
            git checkout -b issue-#
    4. Work on the GitHub issue on this newly created issue-# branch.
    5. Make sure everything builds correctly and all the JUnit tests pass
       ('mvn test'). [Note: On occasion, there may be a failure in
       AuthenticatorTest.testGetCurrentUser(). If there is, run 'mvn test'
       again. It seems to be sporadic and it is hypothesized that it is
       related to some sort of race condition in the JUnit tests.]
    6. If you have added any dependencies, please also run
            mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
       to run OWASP Dependency-Check and look at the generated report
       left in 'target/dependency-check-report.html' to make sure there
       were not any CVEs introduced. (Alternately you can run 'mvn verify'
       which will first run the tests and then run Dependency-Check.) Note
       if this is the first time you have run Dependency-Check for ESAPI,
       expect it to take a while (often 30 minutes or so!).
    7. Commit your changes locally.
    8. Push your 'issue-#' branch to your personal, forked ESAPI GitHub repo. E.g.,
            $ git checkout issue-444
            $ git remote -v | grep origin       # Confirm 'origin' refers to YOUR PERSONAL GitHub repo
            $ git push origin issue-444         # Push the committed changes on the 'issue-444' branch
    9. Go to your personal, forked ESAPI GitHub repo (web interface) and create a
       'Pull Request' from your 'issue-#' branch.
   10. Back on your local personal laptop / desktop, merge your issue branch with
       your local 'develop' branch. I.e.
            $ git checkout develop
            $ git merge issue-444

In theory, you can do all this 'git' magic from Eclipse and presumably other
IDEs like NetBeans or IntelliJ). From Eclipse, it is right-click on the
project and then select 'Team' to do the commits, etc. If you choose that
route, you're pretty much on your own because none of us use that.

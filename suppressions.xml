            This suppresses CVE-2019-17571 for the log4j-1.2.17.jar dependency. ESAPI does
            not use it in a manner that makes it exploitable and ESAPI is unable to
            eliminate the dependency completely because our our deprecation policy. That specific
            CVE is the Java deserialization CVE reported in Log4J 1's SocketServer class which ESAPI
            doesn't use.

            This suppresses CVE-2021-4104 for the log4j-1.2.17.jar dependency. ESAPI's
            default configuration uses ConsoleAppender rathere than JMSAppender and
            thus does not use Log4J 1 in a manner that makes it exploitable. ESAPI is unable to
            eliminate the dependency completely because our our deprecation policy.

            For further details, please see:
                https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104 and

            ESAPI does not use this jar directly. It is a transitive dependency of AntiSamy and (as per Dave Wichers on
            the AntiSamy team), it does not impact AntiSamy, and therefore does not impact ESAPI.

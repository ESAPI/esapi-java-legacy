            CVE-2017-10355 in library xercesImpl-2.12.2.jar, which is a transitive dependency, pulled in via AntiSamy.
            It is a Denial of Service vulnerability with a CVSSv3 score of 5.9.

            We are suppressing this because it is believed by the ESAPI and AntiSamy teams that it is a false positive.
            Dependency Check itself doesn't flag this and neither does Snyk. Dependency Check reports it because it is reported
            directly by Sonatype's OSS Index. For futher details, see
            https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/sonatype-2017-0348?component-type=maven&component-name=xerces%2FxercesImpl

            OSS Index seems to have the wrong CPE. They have 'cpe:2.3:a:xerces:xercesImpl:2.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*', whereas the CPE IDs
            associated with NVD are 'cpe:2.3:a:apache:xerces-j:2.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*' and
            'cpe:2.3:a:apache:xerces2_java:2.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*'.

            Note also that this has been reported as GitHub issue #a 4614
